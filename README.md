User is presented with a random series of button presses.
Each time a user input a series of button presses correctly,user see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
User hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
If a user press the wrong button, user is notified that he has done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind him of the pattern so he can try again.
User can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
If user want to restart,user can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
user can play in strict mode where if he/she get a button press wrong, it notifies me that he/she has done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
User can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
